## Technologies used
The backend is written with **Express** and hosted on Railway. Authentication, databases and files storage are handled by **Supabase**.
The web app is built using **React** and hosted on Netlify.

## What I learned
- Increasing security on the backend by better handling user verification in requests
- Using Supabase for all the backend needs, first time using a relational database (PostgreSQL)
- Add localization to a React app using [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl)
- Experimenting with color theme switching
- Populate the website with dummy users using [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker)

## Known bugs
- Rapidly clicking on the "like" icon on a post makes to likes counter go wrong
